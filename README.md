## Motives of Using Distributed Systems

1. Consensus

The need for a solution where we need to reach a consensus among parties that are dispersed geographically (e.g. online banking, blockchain, bidding platform, etc.)

2. Resource Sharing

* Distributed Databases
* Distributed File Systems
* E.g. BitTorrent

3. Other Reasons

* Data replication
* Horizontal Scalability
* Availability, etc...

## Types of Distributed Systems

Coupling & Scale

* Cluster Computing
  * Homogeneous
  * Management is centralized
  * Used for high-performance minimum downtime
* Grid Computing
  * Heterogeneous and geographically dispersed
  * Management is decentralized
  * Used for large data repositories and high computing power requirements

Architectural Model

* Layered Model 
* Object-based Model
* Data-centered Model
* Event-based Model

## Advantages of Distributed Systems

* Reliability
* **Scalability**
* Fault Tolerance
* Increased Performance


## Disadvantages of Distributed Systems

* Hard to detect failure
* Redundancy
* Inconsistency
* Performance bottlenecks
